K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) ML Exercise

On this exercise we will build a Machine Learning algorithm to predic the class of a vehicle.
The dataset comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository, and you can find it here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

This algorithm attempts to classify data points based upon its closest 'neighbors'
